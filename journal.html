                    We are excited to announce that METRO will be partnering with 
                    Seattle-based BKS Studio to host a series of Social Happenings 
                    and Outdoor Imaginings this Summer as part of METRO's Library Field 
                    project. This series of events, both in person and online, will be 
                    opportunities for our member organizations and other partners to 
                    come together to develop a shared vision for what the Library Field 
                    will be. As a starting point, the Library Field is METRO's plan for 
                    an open outdoor space that will serve as:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A shared outdoor programming space for member libraries and 
                        partners; a traditional consortial model offering shared access 
                        to something that individual organizations do not each have. (Think 
                        community gardening, storywalks, etc)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An experimental place to rethink 'collecting' and 'preservation' 
                        from diverse worldviews or perspectives; an exploration of 'different 
                        ways of knowing.'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A retreat, a communal location focused on well-being for library 
                        workers and community partners, but in a reciprocal manner that 
                        considers the well-being of the environment as well.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                We imagine many opportunities for our members to benefit from this new METRO 
                project, and already many delightful use cases have come up in planning for 
                this summer's events. BKS Studio and METRO are planning multiple chances for 
                the community to share, envision, experiment, all of which are meant to surface 
                even more opportunities and challenges for our project. Insights collected 
                throughout the happenings and imaginings will ultimately help METRO make the 
                best possible decisions for our Library Field site selection and potential 
                future uses. 
            </p>

                If you live and work in NYC or Westchester County and you think you might 
                like to participate in one of these sessions or if you have any questions 
                at all, please write to us at 
                <a href="mailto:libraryfield@metro.org">libraryfield@metro.org</a>. Space will be limited, 
                and we will be taking great care to identify diverse and thoughtful cohorts 
                to participate. If for any reason we are unable to host anyone at these events, 
                fear not! There will be many more ways to participate as we move the project 
                forward. This is just the beginning.

            <p>
                BKS is a cultural heritage ideas laboratory and studio located in the traditional 
                lands of the Duwamish, today known as Seattle. Consisting of Sarah Nguyễn and

                more than 10 years of library and archives social and technical programming across 
                the USA including NYC, SF Bay Area, Austin, Seattle, and New Orleans as well as 
                Latin America and Việt Nam to inform the studio's creative research and design

                support in research, pedagogy, multimedia artistry, communication, and community organizing 
                facilitation. The studio's design and consulting practices are grounded by critical and 
                creative participatory co-design methods to activate intergenerational commitment to time 
                and place based experimental spaces. Let BKS Studio impart on you and your partners our 
                knowledge and praxis on how we can all build better relationships amongst ourselves and 
                our surroundings.
