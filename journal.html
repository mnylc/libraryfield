                    This summer the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO), alongside our consulting team BKS Studio, will host a series of community gatherings aimed at bringing together a diverse and creative group of cultural institution workers from New York City and Westchester County. Together participants will share their needs, inspiration, and ideas for the future Library Field project and outdoor site! 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>To kick things off</strong>, METRO members are invited to the following Social Happenings and Imaginings, a series of community-building events. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Social Happenings</strong> are three introductory meet-and-greet gatherings that will explore questions and ideas of working with/in different METRO member groups with an emphasis on developing trust and conviviality. For each Happening (duration 2 hours) activities will include: food and artifact sharing, social and cultural grounding techniques, place-centered storytelling, and community dialogue circles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Imaginings</strong> are two in-depth nature learning, interagency demonstrations, and brainstorming sessions in outdoor spaces. We will focus on bringing together METRO’s current members and potential partners to explore the benefits of place-based programming, learning, and sharing. Participants will be invited to sift through their temporal memories of the region using native-to-space/native-to-place based techniques that center the past, present, and future of the Library Field initiative. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Now for the ask.</strong> For these Social Happenings and Imaginings we want to invite current METRO members, leaders and workers at cultural heritage institutions and other spaces to meet and share with each other their vision for the Library Field. This would include not only your expertise in the fields of galleries, archives, libraries, and museums but also your insights as inhabitants and enjoyers of the local environments, land, and resources found in New York City and Westchester County. Your views will help craft the future of the project! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>So then when can we meet you?</strong> The following three opportunities will be open for participant registration from May 27th to June 21st, 2024 on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you cannot make these events, check back in June as we will be sharing details on the next series of events for the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Invitations will be sent out via email. Please get in contact with libraryfield@metro.org for more information.

                The Library Field is a new project for METRO. We are looking for a nonurban, semi-rural outdoor location that our network of libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations can use as a shared programming space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, METRO took part in a nationwide initiative that revealed some of the implications of moving library programs and services outside of buildings. Cultural institutions all over the country refocused their efforts on safe outdoor programming through environmental education, storywalks, community gardening, nature connectedness work, citizen science projects, and more. Based on what we learned during that difficult time, METRO plans to open a permanent facility that will serve our region and become a prototype for a new service model for libraries, their partners, and their communities. With activities situated somewhere between those of a park, a preserve, a museum, and a library, the Library Field will be a shared environment that will deepen the community’s understanding of the natural world and the way that we study it, find inspiration in it, and are responsible for its protection.

                    We are excited to announce that METRO will be partnering with 
                    Seattle-based BKS Studio to host a series of Social Happenings 
                    and Outdoor Imaginings this Summer as part of METRO's Library Field 
                    project. This series of events, both in person and online, will be 
                    opportunities for our member organizations and other partners to 
                    come together to develop a shared vision for what the Library Field 
                    will be. As a starting point, the Library Field is METRO's plan for 
                    an open outdoor space that will serve as:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A shared outdoor programming space for member libraries and 
                        partners; a traditional consortial model offering shared access 
                        to something that individual organizations do not each have. (Think 
                        community gardening, storywalks, etc)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An experimental place to rethink 'collecting' and 'preservation' 
                        from diverse worldviews or perspectives; an exploration of 'different 
                        ways of knowing.'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A retreat, a communal location focused on well-being for library 
                        workers and community partners, but in a reciprocal manner that 
                        considers the well-being of the environment as well.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                We imagine many opportunities for our members to benefit from this new METRO 
                project, and already many delightful use cases have come up in planning for 
                this summer's events. BKS Studio and METRO are planning multiple chances for 
                the community to share, envision, experiment, all of which are meant to surface 
                even more opportunities and challenges for our project. Insights collected 
                throughout the happenings and imaginings will ultimately help METRO make the 
                best possible decisions for our Library Field site selection and potential 
                future uses.

                If you live and work in NYC or Westchester County and you think you might 
                like to participate in one of these sessions or if you have any questions 
                at all, please write to us at 
                <a href="mailto:libraryfield@metro.org">libraryfield@metro.org</a>. Space will be limited, 
                and we will be taking great care to identify diverse and thoughtful cohorts 
                to participate. If for any reason we are unable to host anyone at these events, 
                fear not! There will be many more ways to participate as we move the project 
                forward. This is just the beginning.
